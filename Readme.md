Develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot that handles customer
complaints by creating complaint records via API calls, collecting follow-up details (name,
phone number, email, complaint details), generating a unique complaint ID, and retrieving
complaint details when queried with the complaint ID.
